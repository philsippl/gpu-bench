TODO:
=====
- implement p32
- remove query transfer
- tune hyperparameters: batch size, chunk size
- dedicated implementation for p16 and u16
- implement async mem for p16
- implement async mem for u16

Benchmarks:
===========
- focus on p16, u16, p32, u32
- melem/s vs. batch size (line plot)
- best against each other + cpu (bar plot)
- bench h100, a100, rtx 4090
- compare to triton fp32 matmul kernel
- maximum db size on h100
- mem transfer vs. compute time
- async memory transfer vs. sync
- $ cost estimate for 10M at 10 req/s and compare to CPU

Paper:
======
- memory transfer importance -> p5.16xlarge far away from maximum PCIe 5.0 throughput
    - could be interesting to build a system optimized for GPU PCI throughput
    - async memory
- signed int8 math on bytes and conversion to unsigned
- bc of memory transfer dominance, a100 (80 gb) could be used to save costs
-
